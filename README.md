# Matplotlib-Challenge

This analysis includes summary statistic dataframes for all of the treatment regimens throughout the course of the study.

Bar Plots & Pie Plots were generated using both Pandas & Matplotlib.

Detailed analyisis of the 4 most promising drug regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol & Ceftamin):
Quartiles & IQR were calculated to determine potential outliers
Box & whisker plot of the final tumor volumes for each of the 4 treatment regimens

A line graph was generated for mouse that was treated with Capomulin to examine tumor volume over time

A scatter plot was generated of mouse weight vs. average tumor volume for Capomulin treatment regimen

Additional calculations:
Correlation coefficient & linear regression model (mouse weight vs average tumor volume) for Capomulin treatment regimen
